### Props
Props (short for properties) in React are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to communicate with each other and are a fundamental part of building a component-based architecture in React. Here are some key reasons why props are used in React:

#### Passing Data from Parent to Child:
Props enable the parent component to pass data down to its child components. This is essential for sharing information between components in a hierarchical structure.

#### Read-Only Data in Child Components:
Props are considered read-only within a component. This means that child components cannot modify the values passed to them via props. This restriction helps maintain a clear data flow and avoids unintended side effects.

#### Data Flow in Unidirectional:
React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows down from parent to child components. This helps maintain a clear and predictable flow of data, making it easier to understand and debug the application.
