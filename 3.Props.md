### Props
Props (short for properties) in React are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to communicate with each other and are a fundamental part of building a component-based architecture in React. Here are some key reasons why props are used in React:

#### Passing Data from Parent to Child:
Props enable the parent component to pass data down to its child components. This is essential for sharing information between components in a hierarchical structure.

#### Component Composition:
React encourages a composition-centric approach, where complex UIs are built by composing smaller, reusable components. Props allow these components to receive and display different sets of data based on the needs of the parent component.

#### Customization and Configurability:
Props provide a way to customize and configure child components. By passing different values as props, you can reuse the same component in various contexts, making it versatile and adaptable.

#### Dynamic UIs:
Props play a crucial role in creating dynamic UIs. Components can be configured to display different content or behave differently based on the props they receive. This dynamic behavior is especially useful in response to user interactions or changing data.

#### Maintaining State in Parent Components:
Instead of storing all the data within a component's local state, props allow you to maintain the state at a higher level, typically in a parent component. The parent component can then pass relevant data as props to its children.

#### Read-Only Data in Child Components:
Props are considered read-only within a component. This means that child components cannot modify the values passed to them via props. This restriction helps maintain a clear data flow and avoids unintended side effects.

#### Data Flow in Unidirectional:
React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows down from parent to child components. This helps maintain a clear and predictable flow of data, making it easier to understand and debug the application.
