### What is React?
> React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. 
Itâ€™s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React allows
developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast,
scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application.
