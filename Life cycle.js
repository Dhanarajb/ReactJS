React's component lifecycle can be broadly categorized into three main phases:

Mounting: This phase represents the initial creation of a component and includes the following lifecycle methods:

constructor: This is called when an instance of the component is being created.
render: It renders the component's content to the DOM.
componentDidMount: Called after the component has been added to the DOM. It's often used for making network requests or setting up subscriptions.
Updating: This phase occurs when a component is re-rendered due to changes in its props or state. Key lifecycle methods in this phase are:

shouldComponentUpdate: It allows you to control whether the component should update or not based on new props or state.
render: Re-renders the component with updated data.
componentDidUpdate: Called after the component is re-rendered, often used for performing side effects when the component updates.
Unmounting: This phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. The primary lifecycle method in this phase is:

componentWillUnmount: Called just before a component is removed from the DOM. It's used for cleaning up resources and subscriptions.
