A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

 A HOC is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React's preference to compositional nature over inheritance.

But, first what are Higher-Order Functions?

A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.

Eg Array.prototype.map, Array.prototype.filter and Array.prototype.reduce are some of the Higher-Order functions built into the language.
