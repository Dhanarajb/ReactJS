### Error boundaries 
Error boundaries in React serve as a way to catch JavaScript errors during the rendering phase and lifecycle methods of a component. They help prevent the entire React application from crashing due to unhandled errors in a component subtree. Error boundaries allow you to gracefully handle errors by providing fallback UI or logging the errors, enhancing the robustness and user experience of your application. Here are some reasons why error boundaries are useful:

#### Preventing Uncaught Errors:
Without error boundaries, an unhandled error in any component could lead to the entire React application crashing. Error boundaries act as a safety net by capturing errors within their subtree and preventing them from propagating to the entire application.

#### Maintaining Application Stability:
By catching errors at the component level, error boundaries contribute to the overall stability of the application. Even if one part of the UI encounters an error, other parts can continue to function without disruption.
