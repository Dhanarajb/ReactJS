> In ReactJS, lifecycle methods are methods that are invoked at different stages in the lifecycle of a component. These methods allow developers to perform actions at specific points during the component's existence, such as when it is being created, updated, or destroyed. Here's a real-world example of using lifecycle methods in React:

> Let's consider a simple example of a "Timer" component that displays the elapsed time since it was mounted:
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Timer extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      elapsedTime: 0
    };
  }

  // componentDidMount is called after the component is rendered to the DOM
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState((prevState) => ({
        elapsedTime: prevState.elapsedTime + 1
      }));
    }, 1000);
  }

  // componentDidUpdate is called whenever the component is updated
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log('Component updated:', prevState, '->', this.state);
  }

  // componentWillUnmount is called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerInterval);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Timer</h2>
        <p>Elapsed Time: {this.state.elapsedTime} seconds</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Timer;
```
> **componentDidMount**: When the Timer component is mounted to the DOM, it starts a timer using setInterval to update the elapsedTime state every second.

> **componentDidUpdate**: This lifecycle method is invoked whenever the component is updated. In this case, we log the previous state and the current state to the console.

> **componentWillUnmount**: This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM. Here, we clear the interval to stop the timer and prevent memory leaks.

#### In functional components, 
> React introduced a new feature called Hooks to manage state and lifecycle events. The useEffect hook is commonly used to handle side effects in functional components, similar to how lifecycle methods are used in class components. Here's an example of a functional component with the equivalent functionality using the useEffect hook:
```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const TimerFunctional = () => {
  const [elapsedTime, setElapsedTime] = useState(0);

  // useEffect with an empty dependency array is equivalent to componentDidMount
  useEffect(() => {
    const timerInterval = setInterval(() => {
      setElapsedTime((prevElapsedTime) => prevElapsedTime + 1);
    }, 1000);

    // Cleanup function (equivalent to componentWillUnmount)
    return () => {
      clearInterval(timerInterval);
    };
  }, []); // empty dependency array means this effect runs once after the initial render

  // useEffect without a dependency array is equivalent to componentDidUpdate
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component updated:', elapsedTime);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Timer (Functional Component)</h2>
      <p>Elapsed Time: {elapsedTime} seconds</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TimerFunctional;
```
> The useEffect hook with an empty dependency array ([]) is equivalent to componentDidMount. It runs after the initial render and starts the timer using setInterval.

> The cleanup function returned from the useEffect hook is equivalent to componentWillUnmount. It clears the interval to stop the timer when the component is unmounted.

> Another useEffect hook without a dependency array is equivalent to componentDidUpdate. It runs after every render, and in this case, it logs the updated elapsedTime to the console.
