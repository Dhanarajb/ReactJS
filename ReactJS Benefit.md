#### ReactJS Benefits
##### Declarative
> It uses a declarative approach, which means developers can describe how they want the user interface to look based on the current state of the application. Instead of manually updating the webpage when things change, developers tell React what they want, and React takes care of updating the actual display to match that description. This makes it easier to understand and debug the code, as developers can focus on describing the desired outcome rather than dealing with the nitty-gritty details of updating the web page.
