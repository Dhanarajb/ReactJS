Passing data from parent components to child components in React is a fundamental concept. It allows you to share information and state between different parts 
  of your application. Props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from parent to child components. Here's how you can create components that accept 
    and use props:

Step 1: Create Parent and Child Components

Let's start by creating a simple parent component and a child component. We'll pass data from the parent to the child using props.

ParentComponent.js:


import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
  // Data to be passed to the child component
  const greeting = 'Hello, World!';

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <ChildComponent message={greeting} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
ChildComponent.js:


import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Child Component</h2>
      <p>{props.message}</p> {/* Accessing the 'message' prop */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;
In the ParentComponent, we define a variable greeting and pass it as a prop called message to the ChildComponent.

Step 2: Render ParentComponent

In your main application file (usually index.js), render the ParentComponent:


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ParentComponent />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
Step 3: Accessing and Using Props

In the ChildComponent, we access the message prop by using props.message. You can then use this data in the child component's rendering logic. In this example, we simply display the message as a paragraph.

When you run your React application, you should see "Hello, World!" displayed in the child component, which is being passed from the parent component through props.

This demonstrates the basic concept of passing data from a parent component to a child component using props. You can pass various types of data, including strings, numbers, functions, or even objects, through props, depending on your application's needs. Props allow you to create reusable and modular components in React by making them configurable with external data.

Passing data from parent components to child components using props in React is a fundamental concept. You can also pass data deeply nested within a component hierarchy. Let's explore this by creating components at different levels of nesting and passing data through props.

Step 1: Create a Grandparent Component

First, let's create a grandparent component called GrandparentComponent. This component will contain data and pass it to its child components.


// GrandparentComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

function GrandparentComponent() {
  const grandparentData = 'Data from Grandparent';

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Grandparent Component</h1>
      <ParentComponent dataFromGrandparent={grandparentData} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default GrandparentComponent;
Step 2: Create a Parent Component

Next, create a parent component called ParentComponent. This component will accept data from its parent (GrandparentComponent) and pass it further down to its child component.


// ParentComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Parent Component</h2>
      <p>Data received from Grandparent: {props.dataFromGrandparent}</p>
      <ChildComponent dataFromParent={props.dataFromGrandparent} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
Step 3: Create a Child Component

Now, create a child component called ChildComponent. This component will receive data from its parent (ParentComponent) through props.


// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Child Component</h3>
      <p>Data received from Parent: {props.dataFromParent}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;
Step 4: Render the Grandparent Component

In your main application file (usually index.js), render the GrandparentComponent:


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import GrandparentComponent from './GrandparentComponent';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <GrandparentComponent />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
Step 5: Accessing and Using Props

In this setup, data is passed from the GrandparentComponent to the ParentComponent as dataFromGrandparent, and then further from ParentComponent to ChildComponent as dataFromParent. Each component displays the received data in its rendering logic.

When you run your React application, you will see the data passed through the props displayed at each level of the component hierarchy.

This example demonstrates how to pass data deeply through nested components using props in React. Props allow you to maintain a unidirectional flow of data in your application, making it easy to manage and update data as it moves from parent to child components.
