What is routing in React?

Answer: Routing in React refers to the process of defining different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA) and 
  allowing users to navigate between them without a full page reload.

2. What library is commonly used for routing in React applications?

Answer: React Router is the most commonly used library for routing in React applications.

3. How do you install React Router in a React application?

Answer: You can install React Router using npm or yarn with the following command:

Copy code
npm install react-router-dom
4. What components are typically used for routing in React Router?

Answer: React Router provides components like BrowserRouter, Route, Link, Switch, and Redirect for routing.

5. How do you define a route in React Router?

Answer: Routes are defined using the <Route> component and its path and component props. For example:

jsx
Copy code
<Route path="/about" component={About} />
6. What is the purpose of the <Link> component in React Router?

Answer: The <Link> component is used to create navigation links that allow users to move between different views in your application 
  without triggering a full page reload.

7. How do you pass route parameters in React Router?

Answer: You can pass route parameters by including a colon : followed by the parameter name in the route path. For example:

jsx
Copy code
<Route path="/user/:id" component={UserProfile} />
8. What is the purpose of the <Switch> component in React Router?

Answer: The <Switch> component is used to render the first <Route> or <Redirect> that matches the current URL, preventing multiple routes 
  from rendering simultaneously.

9. How do you handle 404 (Not Found) routes in React Router?

Answer: You can create a catch-all route at the end of your route configuration to handle unknown routes. For example:

jsx
Copy code
<Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
10. What is route nesting in React Router, and why is it useful?

Answer: Route nesting refers to defining routes within other routes. It's useful for creating complex layouts and views where some parts 
  of the UI have their own nested routes.

11. How do you programmatically navigate to a different route in React Router?

Answer: You can use the useHistory hook or the history object to navigate programmatically. For example:

jsx
Copy code
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

const history = useHistory();
history.push('/new-route');
12. What is route guarding, and how can you implement it in React Router?

Answer: Route guarding involves protecting routes based on certain conditions, such as user authentication. You can implement it by 
  rendering a route conditionally based on the user's status or permissions.

13. What is lazy loading, and how can you implement it with React Router?

Answer: Lazy loading involves loading components only when they are needed, improving performance. You can implement it in React Router 
  using the React.lazy() function and the Suspense component.

14. What are route parameters and how do you access them in a component?

Answer: Route parameters are dynamic segments in a route URL. You can access them using the useParams hook or by accessing props.match.params within a component.

15. Explain the difference between BrowserRouter and HashRouter in React Router.

Answer: BrowserRouter uses regular URLs (e.g., /about) and relies on the browser's history API. HashRouter uses URLs with a hash (e.g., /#/about) 
  and works well for applications deployed on static file hosts.

16. How can you handle query parameters in React Router?

Answer: You can access query parameters using the useLocation hook or props.location.search. To update query parameters, you can use the 
    useHistory hook or props.history.

17. What is the purpose of the <Redirect> component in React Router?

Answer: The <Redirect> component is used to programmatically redirect users to a different route or URL.

18. Explain what route transitions are and how you can implement them in React Router.

Answer: Route transitions involve animating the transition between different views. You can implement them using CSS transitions, 
  libraries like react-transition-group, or built-in React Router transition features.

19. How can you handle 404 errors when using React Router?

Answer: You can handle 404 errors by creating a catch-all route (<Route path="*" component={NotFound} />) at the end of your route 
  configuration to render a "Not Found" page when no other routes match.

20. What is the purpose of the <Prompt> component in React Router?

Answer: The <Prompt> component is used to prevent users from navigating away from a page with unsaved changes by displaying a confirmation dialog.
