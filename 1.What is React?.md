## **What is React?**  
React is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**, primarily for **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It allows developers to create **fast, scalable, and reusable** UI components. Developed by **Facebook (now Meta)**, React follows a **component-based architecture** where the UI is broken into independent, reusable pieces.

React is often referred to as a **framework**, but technically, it is a **library** that focuses only on the view layer of an application (MVC architecture). It relies on additional tools like **React Router for navigation** and **Redux/Zustand/Context API for state management** to build full-fledged applications.

## **Advantages of React Over Other Frameworks**
React competes with frameworks like **Angular** and **Vue.js**. Letâ€™s compare them based on different aspects:

| Feature       | ReactJS | Angular | VueJS |
|--------------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Type** | Library (View Layer) | Full-Fledged Framework | Progressive Framework |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy to moderate | Steep | Easy |
| **Performance** | High (Virtual DOM) | Moderate (Real DOM with optimization) | High (Virtual DOM) |
| **Flexibility** | High | Low (Opinionated) | High |
| **Component-Based** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **State Management** | Context API, Redux, Zustand | RxJS (Complex) | Vuex, Pinia |
| **Community Support** | Large (Meta) | Large (Google) | Medium |

### **Why React is Preferred?**
1. **Virtual DOM for Performance:**  
   - Unlike Angularâ€™s **real DOM**, React uses a **Virtual DOM**, reducing unnecessary re-rendering and improving performance.
  
2. **Component-Based Architecture:**  
   - UI is broken into **independent, reusable components**, making development and maintenance easier.

3. **Unidirectional Data Flow:**  
   - React follows **one-way data binding**, making state management predictable and debugging easier.

4. **Flexibility & Ecosystem:**  
   - React does not enforce specific patterns, allowing developers to **choose their own routing, state management, and structure**.

5. **Strong Community & Job Market:**  
   - Huge support from **Meta (Facebook)** and contributions from a large **open-source community**.

## **React Use Cases**
React is widely used for **dynamic, interactive web applications**. Some common use cases include:

1. **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**  
   - Apps like **Gmail, Facebook, Twitter** where only parts of the page update without reloading.

2. **Enterprise Dashboards**  
   - Analytics dashboards, real-time monitoring, and admin panels (**Metaâ€™s Ads Manager**).

3. **E-Commerce Websites**  
   - Dynamic UI with filters, product listings (**Amazon, Flipkart frontend**).

4. **Social Media Platforms**  
   - Apps with live updates, chat features (**Instagram, WhatsApp Web**).

5. **Cross-Platform Applications**  
   - **React Native** allows React to be used for **mobile app development**.

## **Scenario-Based Questions**
### **Scenario 1: Performance Issue in a Large React Application**
**Q:** You have a React application that has become slow. What could be the reasons and how would you optimize it?  
**A:**  
âœ… **Common Issues:**  
- Too many unnecessary re-renders  
- Heavy computation inside components  
- Improper state management  
- Large bundle size  
- Poor use of useEffect hooks

âœ… **Optimizations:**  
- **Use React.memo()** to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
- **Use useCallback() and useMemo()** for optimized function and data storage.  
- **Lazy Loading** with React.lazy and Suspense.  
- **Code Splitting** using Reactâ€™s built-in `React.lazy()`.  
- **Optimize large lists** with **React Virtualization** (react-window, react-virtual).  

---

### **Scenario 2: State Management in a Large App**
**Q:** Your project has multiple nested components. How will you manage the state efficiently?  
**A:**  
âœ… **Approaches:**  
- **Use Context API** for small applications.  
- **Use Redux for large-scale state management.**  
- **Use Zustand/Recoil** for lightweight state management.  
- **Avoid Prop Drilling** by lifting state to a common parent or using Context API.

## **React Coding Questions**
### **1. Implement a Counter Component using Hooks**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### **2. Optimize a React Component Using React.memo()**
```jsx
import React from "react";

const Greeting = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Rendering Greeting Component...");
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
});

const Parent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Dhanaraj" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Parent;
```

### **3. Fetch Data from an API using useEffect**
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const UsersList = () => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setUsers(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Users List</h2>
      <ul>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UsersList;
```

1. **What are React hooks? Name some commonly used hooks.**
2. **What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?**
3. **How does React handle form inputs?**
4. **What is React Fiber?**
5. **How does React handle state management?**
