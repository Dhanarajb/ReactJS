### Hook:
> React hooks were introduced in React version 16.8 as a way to easily add reusable, stateful logic to React function components.

#### useState:
>  useState is a React hook used in functional components to declare and manage state variables. It returns the current state value and a function to update it.
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable 'count' with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
