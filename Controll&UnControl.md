#### Controlled Components:
- **What it does**: React keeps track of the input fields in your form.
- **Advantages**: You have full control over what's happening. Good for dynamic forms with changes or validations.
- **When to use**: Choose this when you need React to closely manage and monitor your form inputs.

#### Uncontrolled Components:
- **What it does**: React lets the browser handle the form inputs.
- **Advantages**: Simpler and less code. Can be faster for basic forms.
- **When to use**: Use when you want things to be simpler or when you're working with non-React code.

#### Which to choose:
- **Controlled**: If you want more control, especially for dynamic or complex forms.
- **Uncontrolled**: If you want things to be simpler or if you're working with non-React code or third-party tools.
