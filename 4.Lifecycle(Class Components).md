### LifeCycle
> Basically component are created, grown by updating and then die

> Three phases: Mounting, Updating and Unmounting

#### Mounting: 
> Component  created and inserted into DOM
  - **Constructor()**: In this Initiate the value, setup the initial state and value. After that call super class
  - **Super()**:To call the constructor of its parent-class
  - **getDerivedStateFromProps()**: This method we called right before rendering the element in the DOM. It takes state as an argument and return an object to update state.
  - **render()**:This method is Required. It convert HTML to DOM
  - **ComponentDidMount()**:This Method is called after the component is rendered also can fetch the data.

#### Update: 
> we can update state and props
  - **shouldComponentUpdate()**: This method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering   
       or not. is invoked before rendering when new props or state are being received .

  - **getSnapShotBeforeUpdate()**: The getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is invoked just before the DOM is being rendered. It is used to store the previous values o 
       the state after the DOM is updated. Any value returned by getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method will be used as a parameter for componentDidUpdate() method.
  - **componentDidUpdate()**:This method is called after the component is updated in the DOM. This method provides the previous props and state value. Allows you to 
       do a comparison of before and current snapshot
