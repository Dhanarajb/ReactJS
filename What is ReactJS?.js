React.js, often referred to simply as React, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) or user interface components. 
  Developed and maintained by Facebook, React is widely used for creating interactive and 
  dynamic web applications. It was first released in 2013.

1. Component Based:
how ReactJS is component-based using a real-world scenario:
Imagine you're building a website for an online store. In this scenario:
Scenario: Building an Online Store Website
Header Component:🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️ 
  You start by creating a "Header" component. This component includes the website's logo, navigation menu, and search bar. Once you've built this component, 
  you can use it on every page of your website.

Product Card Component:🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️  Next, you create a "Product Card" component. This component displays product information, including the product 
    name, image, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. Now, you can use this "Product Card" component to showcase each item in your store, and 
    you don't have to rewrite the code for displaying products on different pages.

Shopping Cart Component:🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️  To manage the shopping cart, you build a "Shopping Cart" component. It displays the items added to the cart, 
  their quantities, and a total price. This component can be used on the cart page and also in the website's header to show a summary of the 
  items in the cart, ensuring consistency.

Footer Component:🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️  You create a "Footer" component containing links to policies, contact information, and social media icons. 
  This component is consistent across all pages of your website and is easily maintained in one place.

Homepage Component:🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️  Your website's homepage is another component. It combines the "Header," multiple "Product Card" components, 
  and the "Footer" component to create a complete webpage.

Product Detail Page Component:🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️  When a user clicks on a product, they are taken to a "Product Detail Page" component. 
  This component uses the "Header," a single "Product Card" component, and the "Footer" to provide detailed information about the chosen product.

Checkout Component:🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️🖇️  The checkout page is yet another component. It utilizes the "Header," a list of "Product Card" components for 
the items in the cart, the "Shopping Cart" component, and the "Footer." This consistent component structure ensures a seamless shopping experience for users.

In this scenario, React's component-based approach enables you to create and reuse these self-contained components. Each component handles a 
  specific part of the user interface, making it easier to manage and maintain your online store website. Whether you're displaying products, 
  managing the shopping cart, or showing navigation elements, you assemble these components like building blocks to construct your web pages efficiently.
