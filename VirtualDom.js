What is the Virtual DOM in React?
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory, which React uses for efficient and optimized updates.

Why does React use the Virtual DOM?
React uses a Virtual DOM to avoid slow direct changes to the actual web page. Instead, it edits a hidden copy, 
then identifies and updates only the parts that really need changing in the real web page. 
This makes React more efficient and your web apps run smoother.

How does the Virtual DOM work?
When state or props change in a React component, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree. It then compares this new tree with the previous one, 
calculates the differences (diffing), and updates the actual DOM only where necessary.

What are the benefits of using the Virtual DOM?
It improves performance by reducing the number of direct DOM manipulations.
It provides a consistent and efficient way to update the UI.
It simplifies the process of creating complex UIs by abstracting away low-level DOM operations.

What is the diffing algorithm in React's Virtual DOM?
React uses a reconciliation algorithm called "diffing" to compare the new and old Virtual DOM trees. 
It efficiently identifies the differences between them and updates the actual DOM accordingly.
