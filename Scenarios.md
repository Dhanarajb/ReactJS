### State Management: 
##### 1. You're working on a moderately complex React application. Explain how you would decide between local component state, Redux, or the Context API for state management in various parts of the application.
> <u>**Local Component State:**</u>
  - Use it for components that manage their own data and don't need to share it with other components.
  - Use it for simple data that doesn't change frequently.
  - Use it for components that are not deeply nested within the component tree.

> **Context API:**
  - Use it for sharing data between deeply nested components without prop drilling.
  - Use it for managing global application state that is not complex or frequently updated.
  - Use it for applications where you need to avoid passing props through multiple layers of components.

> **Redux:**
  - Use it for managing complex, frequently updated global state.
  - Use it for applications that have a complex data model or require time travel debugging.
  - Use it for applications that may grow in complexity over time.

### Optimizing Rerenders: 
##### 2. In a project, you notice some components are re-rendering unnecessarily. How would you identify the cause and optimize these components?
> **Identify the cause:**
  - Profile re-renders: Use React Developer Tools profiler to identify components that re-render frequently.
  - Profiler → Identify re-rendering components

> Optimize re-renders:
  - Memoize computations: Use useMemo hook to prevent unnecessary re-computations.
  - Leverage PureComponent/React.memo: Use PureComponent or React.memo to check if re-render is needed.
  - Memoization, PureComponent/React.memo → Optimize re-renders
