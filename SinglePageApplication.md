### What are Single Page Applications?
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a single web page, website, or web application that works within a web browser and loads just a single document. It does not need page reloading during its usage, and most of its content remains the same while only some of it needs updating. When the content needs to be updated, the SPA does it through JavaScript APIs. This way, users can view a website without loading the entire new page and data from the server. As a result, performance increases, and you feel like using a native application. It offers a more dynamic web experience to the users. SPAs help users be in a single, uncomplicated web space in easy, workable, and simple ways.

#### Examples of SPAS
Gmail, Facebook, Trello, Google Maps, etc., all are Single Page Applications that offer an outstanding user experience in the browser with no page reloading.

For instance, when you open your Gmail account, you can see nothing changes much during navigation. Its header and sidebar are the same in the inbox, and when a new email arrives, it reflects the change quickly by loading its content via JavaScript.
